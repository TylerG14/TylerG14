Hi, I am Tyler, a 21 year old aspiring software developer that has big dreams. I love hardware and software, but specialize in software currently. I am a huge dino nerd that also loves fantasy and loves to game. Aiming to make RoR2 mods if I can figure that out.

Currently I am working on a project with a small group of friends over December, can't say yet what it is but will reveal more as I can.
I am currently learning more Java and some python.

If you want to reach me, just send me an <a href="tyler.geuens@gmail.com">email</a> or a message on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-geuens-512566273/">LinkedIn</a>.
